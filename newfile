MTKA|Vmware|Enterprise A|Store Operations / Merchandising|No|Digital River eCommerce platform has been flexible to work with. But however few limitations in the functionality while we work through different projects, which requires an implementation.|"Notes/Comments/Questions for DR (updated: 04/19/2017)   Operational challenges:  Airwatch add-on product launch (march 24th):  	DR modified the SKU setups in Production which is of high risk   	Missing content updates/prices during SKU setup   	Not notifying us before making the SKU setups in Prod and not letting us know what they did for the SKU setups   	Not QAign the changes after modifying the SKU setups   	We immediately figured it out, fixed it and deployed the changes.  Feedback on DR tickets (Fridays):  	We are asked on Fridays what the priorities are for the next week. We send the info but during calls the topics are mentioned but no confirmations are given. Mostly it is mentioned we will look into it. If purpose of Fridays email is to align priorities and sent prior to meeting it would be great to receive ETAs and confirmations during the Tuesday call.    Communication is not clear:  	QB#1269: When tickets or work is done by DR notes are added that work is done but no confirmation on how to look at the work is given. DR assumes that VMware will know how to view changes. We do know how to look at changes but a proactive message should be added to inform team on the steps to take on all work (to avoid extra questions).    	QB#1271: Example of a ticket were we just receive this confirmation This work has been completed and this is a Japanese issue that was fixed. No proof of work is given and no real confirmation is given to check. It's difficult sometimes to check without any clear confirmation of the work done.  The words This work has been completed are not enough sometimes.   Proof of work is not given to VMware:  	VMware as client should receive proof of the work being done by DR, also screenshot confirmations are expected by VMware but we do not receive that from DR. We acknowledge that this takes time but many times it is very helpful.    QA process from DR is not clear:  	DR mentions that QA has been done but many times errors are still without fix. Without proof of work, screenshots of work done or DRs QA VMware cannot confirm formally the work from DR.   Examples:   QB#1210: Bundle Deal Capability work was confirmed by DR as complete but the bundle capability only works on the US store, the rest of stores have important layout issues that prevent us from launching globally. Also the work does not work on upgrade products and it appears that DR did not have this in scope.   QB#1245: No proof of work is given and we have reported issues.   It would be great to receive proof of work to use this as base for the check that we do on our side next.  Test stores are left without alignment with production:  	A project was started on VMWTST (QB#1152) but the last edits were made directly in production and because of this the testing sites are not aligned with production and this is risky. We look forward to confirmation on ETA for this pending alignment.   Presentation and layout issues on work presented to VMware:  	Solutions are provided to VMware but the layout or design is not taken into account so when the work is presented to VMware we have to provide many comments about the solution looking with weird layout of the elements which does not look professional. Examples: QB#1210, QB#1269.   QA from DR:  	It would be interesting for VMware to understand better the QA process that DR follows to check our work. Is it a dedicated team or different people than the PM or developer that are looking at the final work to check it or is the PM and developer the same ones that assign, develop, implement and QA the work? If the same people that assign, develop & implement work are the ones checking it there is a big risk of overlooking items and we have this happening regularly.   Response time and DR teams:  	We want to confirm if Joe, Scott and Ryan (our main contacts) are responsible for the all following categories of issues or if we have to engage with separate DR teams on the following topics:  - Issue could be on Global eStores   - Partner related issues   - Online Renewals   - Support issues   - My Learn Issues   - EBS issues   - Functionality implementation/Projects      "|"Most of the areas there needs to be improvement like,     	Store Architecture - Site IDs Optimization: To establish Store Maintenance Operational activities easier with minimal efforts. merging both vmware and vmwde would have been useful for the store operations.    	Improvements in DR Pricing Template BPU  currently BPU sheet with SKU, Product Names, Prices is not in organized manner, improvising avoid risk for errors. Currently filtering each SKU and updating the Prices.    This template has been there from the past and needs improvization    	Digital Rights setups through BPU (Bulk Product Upload functionality) instead of manual update: This will reduce the manual efforts by going into each variations in the Product Setup and updating the Digital Rights setups manually.    This has been there from the past and needs improvization      "|"Notes/Comments/Questions for DR (updated: 04/19/2017)   Operational challenges:  Airwatch add-on product launch (march 24th):  	DR modified the SKU setups in Production which is of high risk   	Missing content updates/prices during SKU setup   	Not notifying us before making the SKU setups in Prod and not letting us know what they did for the SKU setups   	Not QAign the changes after modifying the SKU setups   	We immediately figured it out, fixed it and deployed the changes.

MTKA|HTC|Managed|Program or Project Manager / Technology|||||
MTKA|Vmware|Enterprise A|Business Operations|Yes|The way that DR manages the projects and the project management practices or lack of PM practices. |Be more serious and add more people to handle accounts. Having people that manage two accounts at once make the client pay the consequences with slow work, incomplete work, poor communication, low quality of work/design/layout, etc.  |I have the impression that the store we have is an old application that has been hacked with new options. I say hacked because none of the features that have imlpemented by DR for us have a intuitive design (for adm users). It is always very complicated to learn which fields are changed to do what and we always have to keep this in mind because the system is not labeled correctly and we do not formal how-to documents to have in our libraries and be able to teach  new colleagues from our side. Every hack that DR imlpements in the system is a hack done to achieve the end results but without having the administrators in mind to make the changes easy for them (us). I think the features that DRGC offers for us are very old and they are not modern. For example DR implemented the bundle page functionality to upsell products after adding to cart a product. But this bundle page looks very old and it does not have modern functionality with JQUERY for example to make it look more modern. I think that one of the worse things about DRGC is the error pages it shoots to customers, these famous error pages are terrible looking and they cannot be customized so users cannot be informed on what the store page errors are and be able to report them correctly. This creates many confusion for customers and even for admins because when we see an error page we do not know for what it is and even DR doesnt know most of the times. After looking at other CMS solutions I think DRGC is not that modern to be honest. |It is not clear to us which issues are handled by Joe and his team and which are handled by vmware-suuport@DigitalRiver.com and we want to know which issues are for which team? In case we send an email to vmware-support@DigitalRiver.com we have to copy Joe and at the end Joe is the one driving the solutions. We never hear back directly from the vmware-support team and this is weird. We dont know who to contact directly on vmware-support@DigitalRiver.com to ask for day-to-day business activities. We think that many times Joe should not be involved in the issues reported to vmware-support@DigitalRiver.com and that team should take on the issues and follow up with us.   Joe's time is many times spent in issues reported to vmware-support@DigitalRiver.com and it should be spent in giving solutions to the QB tickets we have open and not customer service support.   
MTKA|Autodesk|Enterprise B|Executive Sponsor|Yes|Long history with DR/ADSK and relationship is solid. We still have many areas to focus on and we would need additional support from DR to expand our commerce services based on our Business Model Transformation.

MTKA|Vmware|Enterprise A|Other (please specify)|Yes|I think the platform could use a face lift. I feel like its a little behind its time.

Besides that I think its slow, archaic, its hard to search for anything it. The reporting tool is so slow and tough to search or filter things.  The console, the interface and speed could use a major upgrade.|

MTKA|TechSmith|Enterprise C|Program or Project Manager / Technology|Yes|Digital River is well known in the industry, has experience and has many additional programs like the affiliate program and marketforce to take advantage of.  However, we have run into issues creating the experience we would like to have and see limitations in the amount of flexibility within the program.|Development efforts and getting changes implemented to our platform seem to take too long and have been turned over to us with remaining issues that then need to go back for further development and QA.  There is often mis-communication early on of the specific requirements of the work needed.||
MTKA|Izotope|Enterprise C|Store Operations / Merchandising|Yes|"Answer #1: Digital River has a good platform and product offerings for its customers. However, every feature we ask for so far has been custom solution with at least some development effort associated. This type of arrangement is hard to swallow even for mid-market clients.

Answer #2: While Digital River has a solid platform for eCommerce organizations, it's NOT flexible for customization. Even the simplest customization on the platform requires development effort. "|Faster implementation and better project management.||

Before our new site launched, there should have been an in-depth UX review to set it up for a good user experience.  Instead, we launched a clearly suboptimal site and are now having to dedicate resources to streamline it.

For example, Support is going away on 5/7. If we want to remove Support as an option in the configurator, we'll need to create a new PID/VID from scratch for all of all our products. To avoid setting up 300+ PIDs, we'll have to leave the support pull down, which will tell them support included, and run some JS  to change the name of the support from Advanced to Technical support.
